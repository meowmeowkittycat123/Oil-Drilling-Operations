## Introduction

Lost Circulation is a prevalent problem in Oil Drilling Operations. Sabah M. et. al. (2019) applied CART, Neural Network and other models to predict lost circulation and
concluded that CART is the best performing model.

A data sample (marun_sample2.csv) is provided. The description of the data variables are provided in Sabah M. et. al. (2019) section 2 and table 1 (pp. 237 â€“ 238). The
target Y variable is MUDLOSSU. Note that this data sample is not the same sample as used in the research paper and some data variablesâ€™ unit differs from the paper.


## Objectives
1.  Explore the data and report 3 notable findings.
   
2.State the categorical variable(s) (if any) and explain how you will handle the
missing values in the data (if any).

3. Using 70-30 train-test, conduct (a) Linear Regression and (b) CART to compare the trainset and testset errors. Display the results in a table.

4. Comment on your modelsâ€™ results and provide insights for the business
